##Title: Computational Media Sketching

This short workshop is drawn from the two to three week courses I've taught to
high schoolers for Stanford's Pre-Collegiate Studies program. It's an
introduction to making software that is heavily influenced by the philosophy of
my graduate school in the departments of Computer Science and Computational
Media at UC Santa Cruz. I can answer more questions about that if you're
interested, but the core idea is to use computation, or simply software if you
prefer, as a tool for making expressive media.

##Intro

That is, in order to make games, simulations or just small toys which say
something about the world. This isn't quite the same as thinking about writing
programs as a form of engineering, so it will require you to shift your normal
mindset a little bit. For the next half hour we'll be thinking like artists,
not like engineers.

##Tech overview

We're going to use Javascript today, but its very beginner friendly. If you've
programmed in any language you'll be fine, and we're going to pair up so
hopefully we can share some knowledge. Have any of you heard of the language
Processing? It came out of the MIT media lab, and is "a tool..[processing
slogan]". We're going to use p5.js, a project with the same goals and a similar
syntax but designed as a javascript library. To speed up some of our work,
we'll be using a small game framework called p5 play, which is designed for use
by intermediate programmers making small simple games.
